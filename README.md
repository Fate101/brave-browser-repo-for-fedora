# Brave Browser Repo for Fedora

## Summary
So the way that Brave tells you to install the Brave Browser doesn't work anymore (I believe since Fedora 40 but idk). So I did the required edits to the repo and written down the commands to add it.
Why? I get bored and reinstall my Operating Systems every so often. So here ya go!

**BRAVE PLEASE FIX THIS**
